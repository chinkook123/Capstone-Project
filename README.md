Love and Dating can be hard. And as most of us would probably agree finding the right person can be a frustrating, often discouraging task as you go from person to person trying to find “the one”. In addition, people are more and more preoccupied with their careers and other responsibilities, and having a vibrant and active social life often requires an extensive amount of time and energy that many people, especially working professionals, simply do not have. Because of these reasons and many others, people are turning to online dating as a solution to resolve these issues.

My hope is to create an algorithm that can best match or pair any new user with their perfect match in a given dataset based on their similarity using Natural Language Processing.
