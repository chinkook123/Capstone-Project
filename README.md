# Capstone-Project

Crime has always been an issue in the city of Los Angeles. The Los Angeles Times reported that crime in LA increased in all categories in 2015. It has become so common, in fact, that it is almost expected in many cases. 

"But end-of-the-year violent crime figures all showed increases: Police reported 280 homicides, up 10.2% from last year, and 1,097 shooting victims, a 12.6% increase.

Rapes were up 8.6% and robberies rose 12.3%, while the biggest change came in the category of aggravated assault, which climbed 27.5%.

Some portion of the increase in serious assaults was the result of improvements in how the department classifies those offenses, Moore said. LAPD officials launched reforms after a 2014 Los Angeles Times investigation found widespread errors in how assaults were classified.

Property offenses also fueled the overall increase, including burglary (4.8%), personal theft (6.3%), theft from vehicles (15.1%) and motor vehicle thefts (16.7%).

All 21 LAPD divisions reported crime increases this year." (http://www.latimes.com/local/crime/la-me-crime-stats-20151230-story.html). 

Given limited resources of money, personnel, and time, it is very difficult to possibly cover every inch of Los Angeles in order to prevent crimes
from happening. But what if we were able to prevent crimes before they happened or at the very least allocate appropriate resources to specifically target areas "trouble" areas? In this project, my goal is to create an that will predict the type of crime that would happen in any given day, time, and location so that the authorities can better make use of available resources to prevent and reduce crime in Los Angeles.
